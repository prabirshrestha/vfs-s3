# VFS adapter for Amazon S3

This module is an adapter for Amazon S3 to be used with the [c9's Virtual File System (VFS)](https://github.com/c9/vfs).
It provides the necessary functionality to completely abstract the S3 protocol in
order to be used directly from VFS.

This project is work in process.
